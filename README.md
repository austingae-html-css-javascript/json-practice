JSON is a text-based format for representing structured data based on Javascript object syntax. 

JSON exists as a string, and needs to be converted to a Javascript object when you want to access the data. 

/*
JSON.parse(data) means turning data from string to Javascript object
JSON.stringify(data) means turning data from Javascript object to string
